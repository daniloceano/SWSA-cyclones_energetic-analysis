# Cyclone Periods Analysis Workflow

## Introduction

This directory contains scripts for analyzing cyclone periods. The workflow involves multiple steps to process cyclone data and generate period statistics.

## Workflow

1. **export_periods.py**: This script exports cyclone periods to a CSV file. It reads tracks from the `raw_data` directory and creates CSV files for each cyclone.

2. **export_species.py**: This script processes the data generated by `export_periods.py` and categorizes cyclone systems based on their life cycle phases. It counts the number of systems in each category and calculates seasonal statistics. The results are saved in CSV files, providing insights into the distribution of cyclone phases.

## File Structure

Make sure the following directory structure is in place:

- `raw_data/`: Contains cyclone track data.
- `periods/`: Periods output directory.
- `periods_didactic/`: Directory for didactic periods.
- `periods_species_statistics/`: Statistics output directory.

## Code Configuration

- You can modify various options in the scripts, such as vorticity column or smoothing settings, as needed. Refer to the script files for details.

## Testing and Troubleshooting

- To test the workflow, ensure that input files are correctly placed in the `raw_data` directory.

For more detailed information about each script's functionality and usage, please refer to the respective script files.
